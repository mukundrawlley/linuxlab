# ü§ñ AUTOMATION USING SHELL SCRIPT
## üìù Assignment 4 ‚Äì File & Backup Automation

**Objective:** Automate file management using Bash scripting.  

---

## üìå Task 1: Writing the Script `backup.sh`

### üéØ Purpose
The script will:  
1. Find all `.txt` files in the current folder.  
2. Copy them into a `backup/` directory.  
3. Add a **timestamp** to the filename for versioning.  

---

### üìú Script Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh

# Create backup directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist
mkdir -p backup

# Get current timestamp
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Find and copy all .txt files into backup folder with timestamp
for file in *.txt
do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    cp "$file" "backup/${file%.txt}_$timestamp.txt"
    echo "Backed up: $file -> backup/${file%.txt}_$timestamp.txt"
  fi
done
```
---

## üìå Task 2: Testing the Script

### 1. Create some .txt files:
```bash
echo "Hello World" > file1.txt
echo "Backup test" > file2.txt
```
### 2. Run the script:
```bash
./backup.sh
```
### Check the backup/ folder:
```bash
backup/file1_20250909_120530.txt
backup/file2_20250909_120530.txt
```

## üìå Task 3: Documentation ‚Äì How the Script Works

1. **`mkdir -p backup`** ‚Üí ensures the `backup/` folder exists.  
2. **`timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")`** ‚Üí creates a unique timestamp.  
3. **`for file in *.txt`** ‚Üí loops through all `.txt` files in the current directory.  
4. **`cp "$file" "backup/${file%.txt}_$timestamp.txt"`** ‚Üí copies each file to the `backup/` folder with timestamp in the name.  
5. **`echo`** ‚Üí prints a confirmation message for each file backed up.  
---
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Run

**Command:**
```bash
./backup.sh
```
**output**
```bash
Backed up: file1.txt -> backup/file1_20250909_120530.txt
Backed up: file2.txt -> backup/file2_20250909_120530.txt
```

# ‚ùì Extra Questions

### Q1: What is the difference between `cp`, `mv`, and `rsync`?
- **`cp`** ‚Üí copies files or directories.  
- **`mv`** ‚Üí moves or renames files/directories (the original is removed).  
- **`rsync`** ‚Üí advanced copy tool that syncs files/directories efficiently (supports incremental backup, remote copy, and compression).

### Q2: How can you schedule scripts to run automatically?

#### ‚úÖ Using cron jobs in Linux:
1. Open crontab:  
```bash
crontab -e
```
2.Add a job (example: run backup every day at midnight):
```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
```
#### ‚úÖ Using systemd timers:

For more complex scheduling, `systemd` timers can be used instead of cron.
