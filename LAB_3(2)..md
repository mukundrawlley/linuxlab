# ⚡ Intermediate & Advanced Terminal Commands  
*(Linux, macOS, Git Bash – System Admin & DevOps Essentials)* 
````markdown
Once you’re comfortable with the basics, it’s time to level up 💻.  
These commands let you **manage users, control permissions, monitor system performance, and handle networking**.  
````
## 🔹 1. Run Commands as Admin – `sudo`  

`sudo` = **SuperUser DO** → lets you run commands with **root privileges**.  

```bash
sudo command
````

Examples:

```bash
sudo apt update    # Update package list (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo reboot        # Restart the system
```
📌 You’ll be asked for your password.

## 🔹 2. User Management (Linux/macOS)

### 👤 Add a New User

```bash
sudo adduser newusername
```

### 🔑 Change User Password

```bash
sudo passwd newusername
```

### 👥 Modify User (e.g., add to a group)

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

Example:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice   # Give Alice admin rights
```

### ❌ Delete a User

```bash
sudo deluser username
sudo deluser --remove-home username   # Also delete home directory
```

## 🔹 3. File Permissions & Ownership

### 🔐 `chmod` – Change Permissions

chmod 755 script.sh    # Owner: rwx, Group/Others: rx
chmod +x file.sh       # Add execute permission
chmod -x file.sh       # Remove execute permission
```

### 📊 Permission Number Reference

| Number | Meaning                |

| 4      | read only              |
| 0      | no permission          |

Example:

```bash
chmod 644 file.txt   # Owner: rw, Group: r, Others: r

# 🎯 Pro Tip

These commands give you **control over users, files, and system health**.
👉 Always be careful with `sudo`, `rm`, and `kill` — they can change or break your system if misused.

🚀 Practice in a **VM or test environment** before using them on your main machine!
